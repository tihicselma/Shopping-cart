# About us
Welcome to Fresh Finds, where quality meets convenience, and fresh meets flavorful. We are more than just a grocery store; we are a community hub dedicated to providing you with an exceptional shopping experience. Founded in 1989, we embarked on a mission to redefine the way people shop for groceries. 

## Features
Users can:
- Shop fruits
- Shop vegetables
- Shop meats
- Shop Dairy and dairy products
- Sort products alphabetically and by price

#About the project:
The main goal of the project is to create a working grocery store webpage that allows users to shop for a variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy products. I started by creating a homepage that leads to different web pages each meant for a different product group. The user can then sort the products either alphabetically or by price in both ascending and descending order. The biggest challenge was the shopping cart. My thought process for the shopping cart was clear. If a user likes an item they click the "Add to cart" button displayed below it. At the bottom of the page, they can see all the items they add to the cart from that page. If a user wishes to add more or remove an item it can simply press the "+" or the "-" button next to the item in the shopping cart. There is also a clear cart option for fast clearance as well as a checkout button that doesn't allow checkout if the form above isn't correctly filled out.

#Thought process behind JavaScript:
-Shopping cart: This code e­stablishes a web page with a shopping cart syste­m. Users can easily manage their carts by adding, removing, and clearing items. Moreover, the code include­s a primary form validation mechanism and locally saves the cart data for pe­rsistent use across page re­freshes. Ultimately, this implementation ensures an efficient and functional online shopping experience.
-Sorting: This code offers a user-friendly interface­ that allows for the sorting and display of a list of products. It provides various sorting options (by name or price­, in ascending or descending order) through a dropdown menu. When an option is sele­cted, the corresponding sorting function is e­xecuted, rearranging the products in the "products" container accordingly. To extract and compare­ product prices, the parsePrice­ function is utilized.
